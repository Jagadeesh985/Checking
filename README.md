# MultiFactor_Authentication_Using_Image_And_Video_Steganography
We did this for BTECH major project.Our Team consists of 5 members including me M Jagadeesh,B Raghava,B Likitha,K Lakshmi.We did this project under guidance of Krishna Priya Mam.
We have choosen React.js for front end and Django for backend and Django Restful Api.
Now a days OTP's are bruteforeced easily.So in order to overcome this we came with an to authenticate user based on techniques like Image and Video Steganography.Using Least Significan Method 
we can hide the information in the every pixel, where both the normal and image in which data is hidden looks familiar.So we tried to achieve this same technique in video steganography too.Video is collectio of frames so we took random frame and we hided secret text in it.But the real security feature is that in which frame we hided the image is random.So it becomes very difficult to even guess the frame evn if you want to decode it.
